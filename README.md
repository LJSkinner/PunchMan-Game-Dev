## PunchMan 2D Game Dev Game

2D Game created in Java. Originally from Game Dev module at Uni. Engine was provided and the focus was on Animations, Sprites, Collision, The game world and sounds. (Grade: 80%)

There are a few bugs left over in this that could be improved in the future.

## Future Work Steps

I began improving this on 21/09/2022. 

This game was made for a Uni class, which means it had several restrictions in place of what could be used. I wanted to challenge myself by sticking
to these restrictions and the bounds of the requirements when I improve it. That means I will not use any third party code that I did not write myself and
I will stick to the library that was provided (this also means sticking to Java SE 11 features). I currently have two main goals that will include many steps:

1. Address any issues that I identified in my evaluation report.
2. Implement any features I had planned on implementing but did not have time.

The task list below will act as a tracker for these. My hope is to implement up to what I would have considered a "Fully Complete" state, rather than making it
a perfect game.
